# Bacteria-Genomes

Let's filter our genomes using kraken. For this you will need to install the kraken2 client and kraken tools into a conda environment. Remember to change the paths and taxid in the script. 
```
conda activate kraken2
bash "/mnt/storage10/nbillows/mrsa/scripts/QC/KRAKEN2.sh"
conda deactivate
```
